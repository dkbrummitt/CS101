CS101 is a hobby project to remind myself and others why Computer Science basics are important. I recently helped a junior developer to decipher an API that used a vector of vector's to represent a CSV. Do not get me wrong. You can represent a CSV that why, but given all that is available, why would you want to if not at an instructor's direction?

After seeing a gazillion for-loops, some nested. I decided to remind my self

_"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining (or integrating) with your code will be a **violent psycopath** who knows where you live"_

## Inspiration and Alternatives
CS101 was inspired byâ€¦

Read Me Template was inspired by a [blog post](https://changelog.com/top-ten-reasons-why-i-wont-use-your-open-source-project/) on [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/).
The [contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file was heavlily influenced by [HTML 5 boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). The README.md is an amalgamation of several different READMEs. The "features" included were picked because of common practices, design, and UX.
Future versions may include some of the recommendations found on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304863/how-to-write-a-good-readme)

A few Alternatives are:
* [jxson's Gist](https://gist.github.com/jxson/1784669)
* [Repat](https://github.com/repat/README-template) is a kitchen sink of MD templates.

The best resource for finding more alternatives is Google
